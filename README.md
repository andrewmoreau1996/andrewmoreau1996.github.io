# Personal Portfolio

This project is for a personal portfolio to include with job applications or your linkedin page.

## Usage
Because I wanted to build this for anyone form entry-level to senior level developers, the MVP does not use a DB but instead pulls from the project_data.json file. To use this simply update the project_data.json file with your project info. 
A future version of this will include a similar file for the services cards and change all links to a a json file for quick adoption.  


In the future I will be developing a DB branch that leverages mysql and an administrator page. 


## Technologies

## TODO

- Convert to using a DB vs JSON file for data and develop admin page for changing them


### Credit

The base for this project comes from [Start Bootstrap - Stylish Portfolio](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/) because I saw no reason to redesign the wheel.
